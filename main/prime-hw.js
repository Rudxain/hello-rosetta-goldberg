'use strict'

This is a port of [this Python script](https://gist.github.com/raymonstah/5462963e2e857d327965).
â„¹More [info here](https://raymonstah.github.io/posts/2016-06-19-python-hello-world-with-prime-numbers).

The main diff is the way the hex string is converted to an array of hex-nibble-pairs:
I used `matchAll` instead of `match` to make the code more obfuscated by forcing myself to use spread-syntax and `map`.

Oher differences are the way `37` is written as a square plus 1, the omission of `2n * 2n` in favor of bit-shift, and `16` written with shifts or powers.
